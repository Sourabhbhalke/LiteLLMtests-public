In artificial intelligence (AI), a language model (LM) is a statistical model that calculates 
the probability distribution of words, phrases, and sentences. It uses this information to 
predict or generate words or sentences. Language models are foundational to many natural 
language processing tasks such as translation, summarization, and text generation.
